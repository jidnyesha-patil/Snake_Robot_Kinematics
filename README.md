# Snake_Robot_Kinematics
## Objective: Implement forward kinematics for a Snake robot with variable lengths

Analyzed and Implemented kinematics based on "Technical validation of multi-section robotic bronchoscope with first-person view control for transbronchial biopsies of the peripheral lung," by F. Masaki, F. King, T. Kato, H. Tsukada, Y. L. Colson and N. Hata, in IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, doi: 10.1109/TBME.2021.3077356.

Homogenous Transformation to map the lengths of wires to end-effector position detailed in "Limiting-Case Analysis of Continuum Trunk Kinematics.” by Jones, B.A, and I.D Walker, in IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation. IEEE, 2007. 1363–1368.

Note: Sliders used in Live script to change variable values denoting length of each section.

Final positions of end effector for given values shown on a three-dimensional graph as follows.
